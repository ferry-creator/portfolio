    <p class="leading-tight mt-5">
      At age 16, I worked in an SMMA doing "monkey work" like sorting SEO keywords. At 17, I worked for two years in a local animal park before quitting in 2017 to focus on my last year of high school.
    </p>
    <p class="leading-tight mt-5">
      In <span>2019</span>, I worked part-time as a cold canvas phoner while studying web development. Same year, I got my first developer-related job at <a href="https://www.danguitar.dk/" target="_blank">Danguitar</a>. The company was still a startup, so I wore many hats, such as preparing parcels, creating content for advertisement, and managing the product catalog in their CMS. I started automating repetetive tasks with Python, which led to my first professional development job: creating a performance monitor for the customer service department.
    </p>
    <p class="leading-tight mt-5">
      In <span>2020</span>, I started working for Mads Sastakauskas Ã˜stergaard, as his only employee and grew exponentially as a developer with him as my mentor.
      We were both very interested in serverless and SSG with React back then.
    </p>
    <p class="leading-tight mt-5">
      In the summer of <span>2022</span>, his company merged with our biggest client, <a href="https://www.clevertrack.dk/" target="_blank">Clevertrack</a> (a startup), who immediately employed me, and that's where I'm still working today, building their web app and creating internal tools for automation.
