  <p>
    Since I was 16 I've always had some kind of side-project or even
    a business attempt going on in my life.<br>
    Many failed ventures = many valuable lessons.
    <br><br>
    My previous job was also in a startup, and I recently spent
    more than a year trying (and failing) to launch
    <a href="https://symbolik.ai/" target="_blank">Symbolik.ai</a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Right now I'm excited to get back into a job though!</strong>
